  "terms_and_conditions": "This liability-only auto insurance policy provides the minimum required coverage to legally drive. The policy covers bodily injury liability with minimum limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident, and property damage liability of $25,000 per accident. This coverage protects you if you are at fault in an accident and cause injury or damage to others. The policy does not cover damage to your own vehicle. There is no deductible for liability coverage as it covers damage to others, not your vehicle. The policy includes uninsured motorist coverage with minimum state-required limits. Medical payments coverage is not included but can be added for an additional premium. The policy is valid for all drivers listed on the policy. Coverage applies within the United States only. Exclusions include commercial use of the vehicle, racing, and use of the vehicle for illegal purposes. The policy does not cover rental car reimbursement or roadside assistance. This is a basic policy designed to meet state minimum requirements and is most suitable for older vehicles with low market value. The policy requires prompt reporting of accidents within 48 hours. Coverage may be voided if the vehicle is used for ride-sharing services without proper endorsement."
